  <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
<p> My Main interest in IT is that you have ability to build a computer or Robotics from the base up.
My interest it stared in High School with just simple coding that we did for a game for a computer/science activity.
I have intermediate computer literacy skills with a basic knowledge of software configurations.
RMIT was the most appealing due to its course structure.
I hope to learn as much as I can about everything to do with DevOps but I expect with my studies at RMIT I should be able to have clear understanding of IT to implement in the workplace.

<p>The outcome of these test gave me a better understanding where my strengths and weakness lie while pointing out the key points of my personality and learning style.
I would look for people that have differing strengths to my own so we could work in a conducive manner so together we can cover all strengths and weaknesses as a team.
