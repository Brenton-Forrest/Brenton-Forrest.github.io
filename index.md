## <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
<p> My Main interest in IT is that you have ability to build a computer or Robotics from the base up.
<p> My interest it stared way back in High School with just simple coding the we did for a game for a computer/science activity.
<p> I have only an at home learning of the basic software adjustment and configurations at the moment.
<p> I chose RMIT as it looked the most appealing with its course structure.
<p> I hope to learn as much as I can about every thing to do with DevOps but I expect with my studies at RMIT I should be able to ***Master*** the basics in IT.
