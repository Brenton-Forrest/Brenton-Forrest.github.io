<h1> Interest in IT </h1>
<p> My Main interest in IT is that you have ability to build a computer or Robotics from the base up.
My interest it stared in High School with just simple coding that we did for a game for a computer/science activity.
I have intermediate computer literacy skills with a basic knowledge of software configurations.
RMIT was the most appealing due to its course structure.
I hope to learn as much as I can about everything to do with DevOps but I expect with my studies at RMIT I should be able to have clear understanding of IT to implement in the workplace.

<h1> Ideal Job </h1>
<p> Here is copy of an ideal job that I would hope to gain after completing this course with the relevant experience.

<p> The outcome of these test gave me a better understanding where my strengths and weakness lie while pointing out the key points of my personality and learning style.
I would look for people that have differing strengths to my own so we could work in a conducive manner so together we can cover all strengths and weaknesses as a team.

<h1> Project Idea </h1>

<p>My project idea would be to build a new type of computer or laptop that is fast, cheap and reliable, with its own functional operating system.
I think it is important for every household to have a good computer with a sound operating system.
A cheap and reliable computer that will last its user longer than a few years that even the most novice of users can operate with ease in line with regular maintenance and system updates.
Maintaining and operating the computer in line with its values should keep the cost down for the everyday consumer by extending the average life of the computer. As our economy braces for more change people will be looking at the best way to save money while not compromising on quality as more and more people find them selves working from home requiring access to a computer or laptop.

<p>According to Jill Duffy of "PC Magazine" advises that even a low-end computer should give you about five years of solid use before it begins to break down. If you are using a higher-end computer with better components, that number could go as high as seven years, found on Techwalla website*.
But from my own personal past experiences it is far less than this, so I plan to make a desirable computer or laptop that is both durable but cost-effective.
I'm hoping to develop an operating system as user friendly as possible while being technical sound ideally for both novice users and advanced users.

<p>The Project will be just like any other computer, no if my project was to succeed it would be revolutionary the operating system alone will be a powerful program that controls and manages the hardware and the other software on a computer while being easy to use and maintain. Regular scheduled updates will incur a small fee the aim of this is so that we can keep the initial cost of the computer low while still providing the quality of a high-end computer system. The software will only be licenced to run on this specific computer this will aid in the prevention of corruption from outside sources.
The hardware of the Project will consist of all the regular parts such as the (RAM) Random access memory or System Memory, Motherboard (the base element of the computer (Computer Brain)), Processor (Central Processing Unit), and a super reliant Lithium Ion battery, Power Supply Unit (PSU), Video or Graphics Card (Graphics Processing Unit), Sound card (audio card), Hard Drive (The hard drive is the memory storage of your laptop or Computer) of at least 10,000 rpm, Cooling fan/s, Card reader slots.
While adding a few extras like a sturdy hard wearing waterproof base and top panel and Keyboard in case of unforeseeable accidents to protect the essential hardware from damage, Dual Webcam (one front and one back) perfect for family or work gatherings with a privacy screen that can be easily slid over to protect your privacy, Full High-Definition Screen (Visual output), a couple of Super-fast USB Ports, backlit keyboard and good quality Speaker System for those music or movie lovers.
With the optional upgrades such as be a multi-core processor for the professional or gamer and multi Hard Drive system, Touch Screen.
All while being a technically sound and reliable yet reasonably priced computer system that last longer than several years so everyday customers are not having to replace every few years. We want features for our computer/laptop that are both visually appealing and durable that will help make this computer/laptop stand out in both tech and cost.

<p>The Project will need access to another computer or Laptop while coding and programming the Operating System,
The software will need to be user friendly as the vision is that this software will be able to be accessed by both novice users (school children & elderly) and advanced users (gamers & professionals).
Some of the Hardware needed for the assembly are Processor (The central processing unit), Motherboard, Power Supply Unit (PSU), Video/Graphics Card (GPU), Hard Drive (The hard drive is the memory storage of your laptop or Computer), Screen, (RAM) Random access memory or System Memory, and of course the man power to assemble and code the project.

<p>The Skills required to build the computer are but not limited to being able to write an operating system, Engineering, Computer and Software architecture, Embedded Systems programming, Problem-solving, communication skills, multitasking skills, C programming, Operating systems concepts: processes, threading, scheduling, memory management, file systems, networking, security, Coding, Data Analytics,
It is very feasible to create a brand-new operating system while assembling the hardware once I have gained the skills needed. However, making it as durable and affordable as I would like may become a challenge due to fabricating and manufacturing costs along with viability in the marketplace.
There may be the need to speak to a product development firm to gain the knowledge associated with concept, design and marketing.

<p>If the project plan is successful, I would have built a new computer or laptop with operating system that is easy to use and operate, durable in both software and hardware while being cheap to assemble.
This may help people on the lower end of socio-economic scale gain affordable access to a computer system as we are continuing to be more reliant on technology and not everyone can afford the massive out lay on a reliable computer or laptop all at once. The initial cost of the compute or laptop will be low we hope to be able to achieve this by charging a small fee for our software updates. Recent events have made us more aware that we are well and truly in the digital age and not everyone has access to a simple computer system that is cost effective. This product should help ease the pressure off schools, parents/Students and professionals with its ease of use and affordability.
